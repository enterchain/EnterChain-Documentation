# Deploy a Smart Contract

Enter utilizes the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the backend. Smart contracts are written in Solidity and they can function on EnterChain as they do on Ethereum.

To deploy a smart contract, you send a ENTER transaction containing your bytecode without specifying any recipients.

After the contract is deployed, it will be available to all users of the ENTER network.\
Smart contracts have a Fantom address like other accounts.

## **Requirements**

* Bytecode (compiled code) of your smart contract
* ENTER for gas costs
* Deployment script/plugin
* Access to an Enter node, either by running your own node or API access to a node.

* [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org): IDE thatâ€™s used to write, compile, debug & deploy Solidity code ll in your browser.
* [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io): Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts.
* [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts): OpenZeppelin Contracts helps you minimize risk by using battle-tested libraries of smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains.
